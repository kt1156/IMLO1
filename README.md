# ðŸŒ¸ Oxford 102 Flower Classification â€“ IMLO1 Coursework

This project was developed as part of the IMLO1 module. It focuses on building a deep learning model to classify images from the Oxford 102 Flowers dataset.

## ðŸ§  Summary
- Used PyTorch and torchvision to train a CNN on flower images.
- Applied data augmentation and normalisation for preprocessing.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy on the test set.

## ðŸ“Š Result
Final test accuracy: **~60%**

This was a coursework submission for IMLO1 and reflects experimentation and learning throughout the module.
